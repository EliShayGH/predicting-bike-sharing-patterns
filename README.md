# Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

This is the first project I created while participating in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree<br/>
The goal of the project was predicting daily bike rental ridership<br/>
In order to do so I used a fully connected MLP network with one hidden layer<br/>
Code is written in python on a Jupyter Notebook platform.
